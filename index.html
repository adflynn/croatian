                    Structured lessons that use audio and text to naturally introduce phrases and vocabulary to
                    learners. Heavily focused on repetition. Learners can either listen to audio or read phrases to
                    introduce new material. Includes multiple choice, fill in the blank, transcription, and
                    translation
                    quizzes to check progress.

                    Well structured learning program divided by units, then chapters, then lessons. A lesson can be
                    completed in about 15 minutes. There are 5 units, each unit has 5 chapters, each chapter has
                    about 6
                    lessons. Each of the lessons is centered around a short two person dialogue which is both
                    written
                    and spoken. The dialogue introduces language concepts in a natural fashion, then learners are
                    led
                    through a review of the vocabulary and grammar from that dialogue. Some cultural lessons are
                    also
                    interspersed.
